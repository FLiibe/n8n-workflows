# n8n-workflows
This repository contains a collection of automation workflows built with n8n, designed to streamline business processes, integrate APIs, orchestrate data flows, and enable AI-assisted operations. The goal is to showcase real-world, production-ready automations that demonstrate low-code engineering, workflow design, and multi-system integration.
📌 Overview

The workflows in this repository cover a variety of automation scenarios, including:

API integrations

Multi-step business processes

AI-assisted workflows

Data synchronization

Webhook-based event processing

Internal process automation

Error handling and retry logic

Messaging platform integrations (e.g., WhatsApp, email)

Each workflow is designed following clean automation principles: modularity, reusability, robustness, and clear step-by-step logic.

📂 Workflow Examples

Some types of automations included in this repository:

API Orchestration Workflows
Integrations across multiple external APIs with conditional logic, data transformation, and scheduling.

Messaging & Chatbot Automations
Workflows triggered by incoming messages to process user requests, validate data, and send dynamic responses.

AI/LLM-Driven Flows
Workflows that generate summaries, classifications, structured data or natural language replies with LLMs.

Data Processing Pipelines
ETL-like automations to clean, transform and synchronize data between systems.

Operational & Internal Tools
Automated tasks for reporting, monitoring, availability lookup, and system notifications.

⚙️ Key Features Across All Workflows

Modular and production-ready workflow design

Extensive use of REST APIs, webhooks, triggers and schedulers

Custom JavaScript blocks for logic and data transformation

Scalable architecture for real-world use cases

Structured error handling and fallback logic

Use of AI models (OpenAI, DeepSeek, etc.) where relevant

Clean JSON exports for easy import into any n8n instance

🧰 Tech Stack

n8n – Low-code automation platform

REST APIs – External and internal system integration

JavaScript – Custom logic, transformations, utilities

LLMs / AI APIs – Automation enhancement with natural language models

Webhooks – Real-time event triggers

Databases & Cloud Services – Depending on the workflow

📥 Workflow Files

All workflows are provided as .json exports and can be imported directly into n8n using:

n8n → Import → From File

Each file includes descriptive naming to identify its scope and functionality.
